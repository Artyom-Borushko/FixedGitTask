I wish I found some better sounds 
No one’s ever heard, 
I wish I had a better voice 
That sang some better words, 
I wish I found some chords 
In an order that is new, 
I wish I didn't have to rhyme 
Every time I sang.

I was told when I get older 
All my fears would shrink, 
But now I’m insecure 
And I care what people think.

My name's 'Blurryface' and I 
Care what you think. 
My name's 'Blurryface' and I 
Care what you think.

Wish we could turn back time, 
To the good ol’ days, 
When our momma sang us to sleep. 
But now we’re stressed out. 
Wish we could turn back time, 
To the good ol’ days, 
When our momma sang us to sleep. 
But now we’re stressed out.

We're stressed out.

Sometimes a certain smell 
Will take me back to when I was young, 
How come I’m never able to identify 
Where it’s coming from? 
I’d make a candle out of it if I ever found it, 
Try to sell it, 
Never sell out of it, 
I’d probably only sell one.

It’d be to my brother, 
‘Cause we have the same nose, 
Same clothes, home grown, 
A stone’s throw from a creek we used to roam. 
But it would remind us 
Of when nothing really mattered. 
Out of student loans and treehouse homes 
We all would take the latter.

My name's 'Blurryface' and I 
Care what you think. 
My name's 'Blurryface' and I 
Care what you think.

Wish we could turn back time, 
To the good ol’ days, 
When our momma sang us to sleep 
But now we’re stressed out. 
Wish we could turn back time, 
To the good ol’ days, 
When our momma sang us to sleep 
But now we’re stressed out.
